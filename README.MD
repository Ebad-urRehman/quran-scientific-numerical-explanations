## 📖 Overview
**Quran Scientific & Numerical Explanations** is an descriptive Streamlit application with a designed to bridge the gap between quantitative text analysis and theological study. It serves as a digital companion that visualizes numerical patterns, already calculated numerical values for various claims, and provides scientific context to specific verses. 

The tool aggregates data from multiple sources to provide users with a "data-driven" perspective on Quran, allowing for exploration of numerical symmetry and scientific correlations mentioned in modern exegesis.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🤖 Context-Aware Chatbot
A specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) style chatbot that assists users in exploring the text.
* **Multi-Source Retrieval:** Uniquely architected to retrieve and synthesize answers from **5 distinct validated resources** ensuring accuracy and depth.
* **Domain Specificity:** Designed to handle queries related to numerical miracles and scientific interpretations without hallucinating outside its knowledge base.

### 2. 🔢 Numerical & Linguistic Analysis
Abjad here refers to a system of assigning numerical values to the letters of the Arabic alphabet, also known as hisab al-jummal.

* **Abjad Calculator:** Algorithms to compute the traditional numerical values of Arabic letters and words instantly.
* **Pattern Visualization:** Visualizes frequency distributions and word repetition patterns to highlight linguistic symmetry.

### 3. 🧪 Scientific Explanations
* **Curated Insights:** A structured module that presents verses alongside their modern scientific interpretations (e.g., embryology, cosmology).
* **Interactive Explorer:** Users can navigate through different scientific categories to see relevant textual evidence.
